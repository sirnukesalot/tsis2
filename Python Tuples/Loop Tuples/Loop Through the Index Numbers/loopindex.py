#You can also loop through the tuple items by referring to their index number.

#Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.

#Example
#Print all items by referring to their index number:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
for i in range(len(thistuple)):
  print(thistuple[i])
