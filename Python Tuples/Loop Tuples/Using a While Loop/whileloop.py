#You can loop through the tuple items by using a while loop.

#Use the len() function to determine the length of the tuple, then start at 0 and loop your way through the tuple items by referring to their indexes.

#Remember to increase the index by 1 after each iteration.

#Example
#Print all items, using a while loop to go through all the index numbers:

thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
i = 0
while i < len(thistuple):
  print(thistuple[i])
  i = i + 1
