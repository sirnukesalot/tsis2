#The else keyword in a for loop specifies a block of code to be executed when the loop is finished:

#Example
#Print all numbers from 0 to 5, and print a message when the loop has ended:

for x in range(6):
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")
#Note: The else block will NOT be executed if the loop is stopped by a break statement.

#Example
#Break the loop when x is 3, and see what happens with the else block:

for x in range(6):
  if x == 3: break
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")
