#You can also loop through the list items by referring to their index number.

#Use the range() and len() functions to create a suitable iterable.

#Example
#Print all items by referring to their index number:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for i in range(len(thislist)):
  print(thislist[i])
