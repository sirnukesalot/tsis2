#Arrays are used to store multiple values in one single variable:

#Example
#Create an array containing car names:

cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
print(cars)
#What is an Array?
#An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

#If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

car1 = "Ford"
car2 = "Volvo"
car3 = "BMW"
#However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300?

#The solution is an array!

#An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.
